# GeoJSON file with capital cities and their coordinates
Since I couldn't find a proper source that could find countries, capitals and their coordinates, I created a GeoJson file myself, which contains all important infos

Use this link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichiMauch/country_capital-cities_coordinates_iso2-3/main/countries-capitalcities-coordinates-iso2-3.geojson for direct access.
